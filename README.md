# draw4me

**draw4me** is a generative art project built with [Processing](https://processing.org/), exploring autonomous drawing with interactive controls.

## Features

- Starts with a single autonomous drawing path.
- Add multiple independent drawing paths by clicking the mouse.
- Press **Spacebar** to pause or resume the drawing animation.
- Drawings evolve smoothly using Perlin noise-based movement.
- Paths stay confined within a margin and bounce off canvas edges.
- Visual effect: smooth, flowing lines created by curves for a natural look.

## How to Use

1. Run the sketch in Processing.
2. Click anywhere on the canvas to add a new drawing path starting from the center.
3. Press the **Spacebar** key to toggle the animation on or off.
4. When paused, the current drawing remains visible without clearing.

## Purpose

This project serves as an experimental playground for generative art and algorithmic drawing. It combines randomness and noise functions to produce organic, evolving visuals that are visually pleasing and unpredictable.

## License

This project is open source and available under the MIT License.
